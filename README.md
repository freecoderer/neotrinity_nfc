## Overview
NeoTrinity NFC is a project designed to implement NFC (Near Field Communication) technology for neotrinity project (A project which is for managning university's facility with blockchain). This repository contains code and resources to interact with NFC hardware and manage NFC data efficiently. The project leverages modern Python libraries to facilitate communication between NFC devices and the system.

## üöÄ Features
- **NFC Communication**: Facilitates reading from and writing to NFC tags.
- **Python Integration**: Utilizes Python for easy scripting and automation of NFC tasks.
- **Modular Design**: Structured to allow easy expansion and integration with other systems.

## üóÇ Project Structure
- **`pn532/`**: Contains the library and scripts related to the PN532 NFC module.
- **`status/`**: Includes scripts and tools for checking the status of NFC operations.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **`README.md`**: The main documentation file for the project.
- **`main.py`**: The main script to run the NFC operations.
- **`neotrinity.py`**: Contains the core functionality and methods for NFC communication.

## üõ† Technologies Used
### Raspberry Pi
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for scripting and automation.
- **PN532 Module**: NFC module used for communication with NFC tags.
